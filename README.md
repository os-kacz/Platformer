A feature that isn't explained in gameplay is the method used to generate levels.

I drew up a 20x14px image with different coloured pixels representing my different gameobjects. The program reads through the image by pixel, creates and sets position of each appropriate gameobject. This allows for quick and easy level creation!

Please find documentation in the Documentation folder in the root folder of the repository.
